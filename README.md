#### About Splic & The Mission


It's a tool, to implement this concept.

Before we can explain what Splic really is we'd like to give a feel of what it does and what's new.
Imagine you have an idea for a song. Any idea, could be lyrics for a song, notes to a particular solo or even just a concept, anything. On this app, you have a network of musicians. Just like those free lancing websites, you pitch a part of the idea and the type of musicians you need for your piece. Musicians from around the world send in their versions of the content (notes) you uploaded for their part. Based on these choices you select a permutation that works for you. You send them the entire content of the song, they record their part and send it to you. You along with your musicians, mix all the tracks sent in, to create a finished piece. This is the basic concept of a virtual band. Musicians can use this app to record as well as mix on a common deck to create a band-like arrangement and make music.

Further each project is open (once completed) for musicians everywhere to listen to or even mix around (further creating their own versions). Each song is stored in its multi track format.
Imagine you liked a particular song. But just the beats and the instrumental parts. You find the vocals really annoying. Using this app, since the songs are stored in its multi track format, you can simply remove the vocals track from the song. Further, you could exchange it with a vocals track from another song easily.

Using this app, you could create a hundred versions of the same song. You could create hundred versions of hundred different songs. The amount of music that exists in the world shall rise exponentially once this app starts dominating.

There is no point reinventing the wheel. On a large enough scale, a single man's achievements stop mattering. And all that's necessary is the growth of mankind. In the music aspect, it seems more efficient to release music in its open state (multi track format, editable), for the world to use, to create richer music.

Thus, Splic is about promoting this concept that we call open source music.
Imagine if this app achieves world domination, artists from all over the world shall use this app to create or release music. Imagine open music becomes a standard. Imagine one powerful app taking care of every aspect related to the word music.
